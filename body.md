## Vitamin D3 + K2 + Magnesium

Why Vitamin D3?

Vitamin D3 isn’t just a vitamin—it’s a hormone that’s crucial for bone health, immune function, and mood regulation. However, its effectiveness is greatly enhanced when paired with the right partners—Vitamin K2 and magnesium.

The Role of Vitamin K2
Vitamin K2 directs calcium to where our body needs it most, like bones and teeth, rather than arteries where it can cause harm. This makes K2 a critical player in maintaining not only bone health but also cardiovascular health.

Magnesium’s Magic
Magnesium assists in the activation of Vitamin D. Without sufficient magnesium, Vitamin D remains stored and inactive; you won’t get its full benefits, no matter how much you take.

Together, Better!
When combined, Vitamin D3 and K2, along with magnesium, work synergistically to:
- Enhance bone density and structure
- Improve calcium absorption and utilization
- Support heart and vascular health
- Regulate immune and hormonal balance

Boosting Your Levels
To effectively increase your Vitamin D levels:
1. Sun Exposure: Aim for 10-20 minutes of midday sun, several times a week, depending on your skin tone and location.
2. Diet: Include Vitamin D-rich foods like fatty fish, fortified foods, and egg yolks. For K2, think cheese, eggs, and butter; for magnesium, nuts, seeds, and leafy greens.
3. Supplementation: Consider a high-quality supplement that combines all three, especially if you’re deficient or have limited sun exposure.

#### Hairs

##### Mela Annurca

Uno studio effettuato dal Dipartimento di Farmacia dell’Università di Napoli ha analizzato diverse qualità di mele come le Golden Delicious, le Red, le Granny Smith, Pink Lady e Fuji, decretando la mela annurca come la mela con il più elevato contenuto di polifenoli e Procianidina B2; ne ha inoltre ottenuto due prodotti in fase sperimentale con lo scopo di contrastare la calvizie.
